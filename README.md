**Live → [www.csstat.com](https://www.csstat.com)**

Look up any CS2 player and get a deep breakdown of how they actually play — pulled live from Steam, Leetify, and Faceit. Three-tier display means **every player gets meaningful data**, even without a Leetify or Faceit account. No login needed.

## Stack

| Layer | Tech |
|---|---|
| Frontend | React 18 + Vite, deployed on Cloudflare Pages |
| Backend | Cloudflare Workers (`fetch` handler, native `fetch` for outbound) |
| Domain / DNS | Cloudflare Registrar — `csstat.com` |
| Data | Steam Web API + Leetify Public CS API + Faceit Data API |
| Styling | Inline styles, custom keyframes |

---

## Deployment

| Service | Host | Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| Frontend | Cloudflare Pages | auto-deploys on push to `main` |
| Backend | Cloudflare Workers | `wrangler deploy` from `backend/` |

Both run on Cloudflare's edge network — no cold starts, sub-second response times globally.

---

## Running locally

**Backend** (Cloudflare Workers via `wrangler dev`)
```bash
cd backend
npm install
echo 'STEAM_API_KEY="your_key_here"' > .dev.vars
# get a free Steam API key at steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey
npx wrangler dev            # runs on http://localhost:8787
```

**Frontend**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev                 # runs on http://localhost:5173
```

For local dev, point the frontend at the local Worker by creating `frontend/.env.local`:
```
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8787
```

> Steam profiles must be set to **public**. Leetify data only shows when Leetify has parsed at least one demo for the player and the player's privacy mode allows it. Faceit data only shows for players with a Faceit account.

---

## Environment variables

**Backend** — production secrets stored in Cloudflare:
```bash
npx wrangler secret put STEAM_API_KEY
npx wrangler secret put LEETIFY_API_KEY    # https://leetify.com/app/developer
npx wrangler secret put FACEIT_API_KEY     # https://developers.faceit.com
```

For local dev, put them all in `backend/.dev.vars` (gitignored):
```
STEAM_API_KEY="your_steam_key"
LEETIFY_API_KEY="your_leetify_key"
FACEIT_API_KEY="your_faceit_key"
```

**Frontend** (Cloudflare Pages dashboard → Settings → Variables, or `.env.local`)
```
VITE_API_URL=https://fragged-api.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev
```

## Roadmap

- **Leetify fallback** — for players not on Leetify, pull from alternative sources
- **AI roast** — Claude-powered breakdown of stats, actually funny, not generic
- **Mobile** — proper responsive layout (currently desktop-first)
- **Map win rates / weapon breakdowns** — per-map and per-weapon performance
- **Share card** — one-click image export
- **Player vs player** — head-to-head stat overlay

See the [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md) for what's already shipped.
